import java.util.ArrayList;
/*
The Restaurant class is a public class that keeps track of our restaurant's orders. 

The class should have an instance variable, orders, that is an ArrayList of Order instances. 
These are all of the orders that have been placed at the restaurant.

The class should have a void method addOrder that takes an Order instance and adds it to the orders ArrayList.

The class should have a int method orderCount that returns the number of orders in the orders ArrayList.

The class should have a double method priciestOrder that returns the price of the order with the highest price in the orders ArrayList.

The class should have a void method printOrders that prints out all of the orders in the orders ArrayList. 
Remember that the Order class has its own toString method to convert an Order to a String.
